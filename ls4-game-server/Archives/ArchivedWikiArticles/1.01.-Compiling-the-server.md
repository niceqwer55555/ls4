In order to compile the server, download and install the following software:
* Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (Community Edition is fine)
* Install latest .NET Framework (Visual Studio Installer should have the options for that)
* Clone the repository with the command `git clone https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer.git --recursive`

Before we start, you need to do the following steps:
* Create file `./GameServerApp/Settings/GameInfo.json`. (There is a template in the same folder called `GameInfo.json.template`)
* Do the same for `./GameServerApp/Settings/GameServerSettings.json` (This has a template in the same folder, too). This is for debugging purposes and if you enable that, as soon as GameServer is ready, it will run LoL for you.

Now you're ready to open `GameServer.sln` with Microsoft Visual Studio and compile the server.
