[SCRIPTS-CORE]

Core project used to create new scripting pages.
Also used for core classes/scripts that the server can run without
but may increase QoL for scripting needs adn examples.

[Commands]
NameSpace: Commands
Inherit Class: BaseCommand

The server loads commands based on their inherited class, "BaseCommand".
So they can be placed within any namespace in any assembly the server is set to load.
However it is best practice to leave them all in the same namespace of "Commands" to minimize issues if changes are made
to the server in the future.

TODO:
- Rework the API to grant access to Core system managers, determining what commands should and shouldn't be able to manipulate or access
