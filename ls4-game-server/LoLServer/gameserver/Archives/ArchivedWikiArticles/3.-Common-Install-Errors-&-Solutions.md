## DLLNotFoundException: Unable to load DLL 'libenet'
Make sure you have [.NET Core x86](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/715dc65d-5906-4365-ab5b-fa8fc8f80a10/32f8fb72e1d704eebee7d8e8cf79f308/dotnet-sdk-3.0.103-win-x86.exe) installed.

If you are more technical, you can build the [ENetSharpLeague](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/ENetSharpLeague) directly for whatever architecture you want (keep in mind x86 is the normally supported version).

## On loading the game it closes and appears BugSplat / ACCESS_VIOLATION error
Place your .bat in the same folder the executable is located. Sometimes, writing a very long path in the run.bat causes problems

## On loading game it says something about firewall (black screen)
Check that the server is open.

## I cannot cast any spells! / I am getting errors saying MapX.json not found!
Run this command in the main GameServer directory:
