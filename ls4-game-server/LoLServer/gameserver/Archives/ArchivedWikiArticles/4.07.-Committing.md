# Commit guidelines

## Always create an issue before committing

All commits should refer to issues. This is simply so that we can better track what is being worked on or what should be worked on.

## Commit Structure:
```
Issue Reference -- Title of the commit

Description of the commit

Issue reference
```
For example:
```
Resolve #123 -- Implement a foobar

Implement foo to the bar module

Refs #123
```

You can also use `Progress` in place of `Resolve`, in case the issue was not resolved yet.
