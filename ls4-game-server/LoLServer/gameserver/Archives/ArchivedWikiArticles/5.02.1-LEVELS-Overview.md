## Introduction
This page is the first page in the [5.02 Creating Custom Maps](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer/wiki/5.02-Creating-Custom-Maps) section of the wiki.

This page lays out all of the basic files required for a map.

Each section topic (i.e AIMesh, Maps, etc) can be clicked on which will send you to another page with more details regarding the topic.

## Client
Within every map folder in the LEVELS folder of the client, these are the minimum files required to load the map:
* Scene folder
  * [NVR Room](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer/wiki/5.0.2.2-NVR-Room) file (i.e `room.nvr`)
* [AIMesh NavGrid](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer/wiki/5.02.3-AIMesh-&-AIMesh-NavGrid#aimesh-navgrid) (i.e `AIPath.aimesh_ngrid`)

## GameServer
Within the data folder of the GameServer, (usually [LeagueSandbox-Default](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/LeagueSandbox-Default/tree/indev)) a map is separated into two folders, `AIMesh/Map#` and `Maps/Map#`.

#### [AIMesh](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer/wiki/5.02.3-AIMesh-&-AIMesh-NavGrid) folder
Each map folder (i.e `Map1`) in this folder requires an `AIPath.aimesh_ngrid` file in order to be loaded by the GameServer.

#### Maps folder
Each map folder (i.e `Map1`) in this folder requires an `Map#.json` file and a Scene folder with a `room.dsc.json` file.

The `Map#.json` file represents all of the combinations of spawn positions of players for each team.

The Scene folder is meant to contain all the references to objects and their basic information such as positions.

The `room.dsc.json` file should contain a list of all objects which should be loaded by the client. Without a reference to an object in this file, the client does not load the object even if contained in the Scene folder.
