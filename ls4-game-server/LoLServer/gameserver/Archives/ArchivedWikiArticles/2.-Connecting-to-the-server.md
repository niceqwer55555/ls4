## Requirements
* The Game Server compiled and running 
* League of Legends 4.20 (Link in the GameServer repo readme)

### Note: If you had configured GameServerSettings.json properly and you only want to play alone, you must already have the game open.

## Instructions

Run `League of Legends.exe` with the following launch parameters:

`"8394" "LoLLauncher.exe" "" "127.0.0.1 5119 17BLOhi6KZsTtldTsizvHg== 1"`

(`League of Legends.exe` can be found in `RADS/solutions/lol_game_client_sln/releases/0.0.1.68/deploy/`)

Pro tip: You can create a .bat **_in the same folder where the game executable is located_** with the content below to open it more easily:

`@start "" "League of Legends.exe" "8394" "LoLLauncher.exe" "" "127.0.0.1 5119 17BLOhi6KZsTtldTsizvHg== 1"`
