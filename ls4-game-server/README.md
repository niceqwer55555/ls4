# League of Legends server emulator
League of Legends Emulator is an open-source application and framework designed for hosting multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. It is based on the popular MOBA game League of Legends (LoL) and seeks to recreate the gameplay experience of the original game.

It is written in C# and provides a solid foundation for creating private servers that try to mimic the mechanics and behavior of the official League of Legends servers from around 2015.
